# django-ice-cream-app

This project showcases a full stack, dynamic ice cream shop web application built using Django, a high-level Python web framework. Developed entirely in the AWS Cloud9 integrated development environment, the application leverages cloud-based tools. The ice cream shop app features a user-friendly interface allowing customers to browse flavors and create orders. On the backend, it utilizes Django's ORM for database management. For deployment, the application utilizes AWS Elastic Beanstalk. Elastic Beanstalk simplifies the deployment process, automatically handling capacity provisioning, load balancing, and application health monitoring.
